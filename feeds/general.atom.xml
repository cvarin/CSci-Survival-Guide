of some sort. If you are about to spend hours in front of a computer, why not making it
enjoyable? Why not getting rid of expensive, overkill, licensed software you do not need? 
You will see, working with open source software makes it nice, whith the feeling that you are in control 
of what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I share my survival tricks: simple methods and techniques that you can 
always rely on. Of course, there are situations where more complex approaches are needed.
But when in doubt, you still have these simple codes you know and understand very well,
to compare and make sure everything is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will find some of the upcoming articles interesting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="introduction"></category></entry></feed>
